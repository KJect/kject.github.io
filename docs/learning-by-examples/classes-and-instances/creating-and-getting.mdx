# Creating and Getting Instances
:::note

KJect treads every class as a singleton.

:::

## Preparing our class
First we need to prepare our class for KJect.
For this we need to define a primary constructor.

```kotlin
class ExampleClass() {
    
    fun doSomething() {
        // ...
    }
    
}
```

:::note

Most IDEs will tell you to remove an empty primary constructor.
Be careful with removing it, if you class has another constructor,
KJect will fail to create an instance of it.

:::

:::tip

You can change the constructor KJect uses with the `@UseConstructor` annotation.

<details>
    <summary>Example</summary>

    ```kotlin
    class ExampleClass() {

        // highlight
        @UseConstructor
        constructor(someParameter: String) : this() {
            // ...
        }

    }
    ```
</details>

:::

## Creating an instance
To create the singleton instance of our class we need to call the `create` function of the `KJect` object.

```kotlin
val instance = KJect.create<ExampleClass>()
```

:::tip

You can use all KJect function without inlining them by
calling them with the class as a parameter instead of using the generic type.

```kotlin
val instance = KJect.create(ExampleClass::class)
```

:::danger

Many things can go wrong while creating an instance.
To learn more on that topic, read the more detailed documentation on [Classes and Instances](/docs/classes-and-instances).

:::

## Getting an instance
In general KJect always tries to return an instance of the provided class.
However, if KJect can't find any instance, there are three different ways to handle this.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Throw" value="throw">
        ```kotlin
        val instance = KJect.get<ExampleClass>()
        ```

        If no instance of the provided class exists, an `NotFoundException` will be thrown.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Null" value="null">
        ```kotlin
        val instance = KJect.getOrNull<ExampleClass>()
        ```

        If no instance of the provided class exists, `null` will be returned.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Create" value="create">
        ```kotlin
        val instance = KJect.getOrCreate<ExampleClass>()
        ```

        If no instance of the provided class exists, a new instance will be created.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Witch of these methods you should use depends on your use case.
